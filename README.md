## Description

- My motivation for making this project was to better understand how to work with javascript and better understand the different concepts such as timers and looping event listeners.    
- I made this to show my understanding of these topics.
- This solves my issues by giving me reference tool to go back and look into how to do these java issues. I will also be using this as a tool for hiring managers.  
- The largest thing I learned from this project is how to correctly add a looping feature in my event listeners.  This was very helpful for learning where to declare certain variables.    

## Installation

There were a lot of ideas when first looking at this project.  I started by writing as much of the HTML as possible and doing the most basic of CSS features.  I then spent a rather long time figuring out how to add event listeners looping through an object full of items.  After understanding this info, I went to work on my timer function which required me to change and add things to the HTML and CSS files.  I couldn't understand how to increment my score and deduct my timer.  That took another few days to look into.
